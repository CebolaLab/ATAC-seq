# ATAC-seq
Analysis pipeline for ATAC-seq data

The following pipeline will describe the step-by-step analysis of ATAC-seq data (the *a*ssay for *t*ransposase-*a*ccessible *c*hromatin with *seq*uencing). This has been adapted from the following resources:

- https://vallierlab.wixsite.com/pipelines/atac-seq
- https://www.encodeproject.org/atac-seq/ **the recommended ENCODE pipeline**
- https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/atac-seq-pipeline **the ENCODE pipeline available on github**

The following steps will be covered:

- Sequencing quality control (QC) 
- Alignment 
- Peak Calling
- Visualisation
- Functional analysis & Motif Discovery
